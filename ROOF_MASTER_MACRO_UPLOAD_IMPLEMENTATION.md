# Roof Master Macro Upload Implementation

## Summary

Successfully refactored the application to use a simplified 3-column Roof Master Macro CSV format and added upload functionality to the estimate page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Python Rules Engine (`roof_adjustment_engine.py`)

**Updated:** `load_roof_master_macro()` method

- **Before:** Parsed a complex text file with multiple columns and calculated fields
- **After:** Loads a simple CSV file with 3 columns: `description`, `unit`, `unit_price`
- **Features:**
  - Case-insensitive column name matching
  - Multiple path search locations for flexibility
  - Robust error handling with detailed logging
  - Validates CSV structure before processing

**CSV Format:**
```csv
description,unit,unit_price
Remove Laminated - comp. shingle rfg. - w/out felt,SQ,67.40
R&R Continuous ridge vent - shingle-over style,LF,10.87
Step flashing,LF,10.28
```

### 2. Simplified Roof Master Macro CSV

**Created:** `roof_master_macro.csv` (3-column format)
- Converted existing 8-column CSV to simplified 3-column format
- Contains 115 line items from the original roof master macro
- Preserved original CSV as `roof_master_macro_old.csv` for backup

### 3. Upload API Endpoint

**Created:** `src/app/api/upload-roof-master/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Accepts CSV file uploads via POST request with multipart/form-data
- Validates:
  - File type (must be .csv)
  - CSV structure (must have 3 required columns)
  - Data completeness (at least 2 rows)
- Saves uploaded file to:
  - Project root: `/roof_master_macro.csv` (used by Python engine)
  - Public directory: `/public/roof_master_macro.csv` (backup)
- Returns:
  - Success/error status
  - Item count
  - File path
  - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Roof Master Macro uploaded successfully",
  "itemCount": 115,
  "filePath": "/path/to/roof_master_macro.csv"
}
```

### 4. Estimate Page UI Updates

**Updated:** `src/app/estimate/page.tsx`

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
const [isUploadingRMM, setIsUploadingRMM] = useState(false);
const [rmmUploadStatus, setRmmUploadStatus] = useState<{
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  itemCount?: number;
} | null>(null);
```

**New Upload Button:**
- Located in the header next to other action buttons
- Blue styling to distinguish from other buttons
- Shows "Uploading..." state during upload
- File input accepts .csv files only
- Icon: Upload icon from lucide-react

**Upload Status Banner:**
- Displays after upload completion
- Green background for success, red for errors
- Shows:
  - Success/failure message
  - Number of items loaded (on success)
  - Dismissible
- Auto-stores upload info in localStorage for tracking

**Upload Function:**
```typescript
const handleRmmUpload = async (event) => {
  // Validates file
  // Sends to API endpoint
  // Updates UI with status
  // Stores metadata in localStorage
}
```

### 5. Storage Mechanism

**LocalStorage:**
- Stores upload metadata for user reference
- Key: `rmmUploadInfo`
- Data structure:
```json
{
  "uploadedAt": "2025-10-14T12:34:56.789Z",
  "fileName": "roof_master_macro.csv",
  "itemCount": 115
}
```

**File System:**
- Primary location: `{project_root}/roof_master_macro.csv`
- Backup location: `{project_root}/public/roof_master_macro.csv`
- Python engine automatically finds file in multiple locations

### 6. Line Item Replacement Rules

**Added:** Comprehensive replacement rules in `apply_logic()` method

**Features:**
- Replaces carrier estimate line items with proper Roof Master Macro items
- Handles 50+ line item patterns including:
  - Ridge vents (shingle-over, aluminum)
  - Roof vents (turtle, off-ridge, dormer, turbine)
  - Power attic vents
  - Exhaust caps
  - Flashing (counterflashing, valley metal, pipe jacks, rain diverters, etc.)
  - Rain caps (multiple sizes)
  - Chimney flashing
  - Saddle/cricket
  - Skylight flashing kits
  - Gutter and drip edge
- Updates unit prices from Roof Master Macro
- Recalculates RCV and ACV after replacement
- Logs all replacements for debugging

**Replacement Logic:**
- Matches carrier patterns (e.g., "Install...", "Detach & Reset...")
- Looks up exact item in Roof Master Macro
- Replaces description and pricing
- Preserves quantity and other fields
- Tracks all changes in adjustment results

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **CSV Format Validation:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import csv
   with open('roof_master_macro.csv', 'r') as f:
       reader = csv.DictReader(f)
       print(f'Columns: {reader.fieldnames}')
       print(f'First row: {next(reader)}')
   "
   ```
   ✅ **Verified:** CSV has correct 3-column format

2. **Python Engine Loading:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from roof_adjustment_engine import RoofAdjustmentEngine
   engine = RoofAdjustmentEngine()
   print(f'Loaded {len(engine.roof_master_macro)} items')
   "
   ```
   ✅ **Verified:** Engine loads 115 items successfully

3. **Price Lookup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from roof_adjustment_engine import RoofAdjustmentEngine
   engine = RoofAdjustmentEngine()
   result = engine.lookup_unit_price('R&R Continuous ridge vent - shingle-over style')
   print(f'Price: \${result[\"unit_price\"]}, Unit: {result[\"unit\"]}')
   "
   ```
   ✅ **Verified:** Lookup returns correct price ($10.87, LF)

4. **Upload API (requires running app):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload-roof-master \
     -F "file=@test_roof_master.csv"
   ```
   Status: Ready for testing when app is running

5. **UI Upload Button:**
   - Navigate to estimate page
   - Click "Upload Roof Master Macro" button
   - Select CSV file
   - Verify success message appears
   - Check that item count is displayed

## How to Use

### For End Users:

1. **Prepare Your CSV File:**
   - Create or export a CSV with exactly 3 columns: `description`, `unit`, `unit_price`
   - Ensure descriptions match those referenced in your estimates
   - Use standard units: SQ, LF, EA, SF, HR
   - Example:
     ```csv
     description,unit,unit_price
     Remove Laminated - comp. shingle rfg. - w/out felt,SQ,67.40
     Laminated - comp. shingle rfg. - w/out felt,SQ,249.37
     ```

2. **Upload the CSV:**
   - Open an estimate in the SPC Claims system
   - Click the blue "Upload Roof Master Macro" button in the header
   - Select your CSV file
   - Wait for confirmation message

3. **Verify Upload:**
   - Green success banner should appear
   - Shows number of items loaded
   - All subsequent Python Rule Engine runs will use the new data

4. **Run Rules Engine:**
   - Click "Python Rule Engine" button
   - Engine will automatically use your uploaded CSV
   - Line items will be replaced/adjusted based on new pricing

### For Developers:

1. **CSV File Location:**
   - Primary: `{project_root}/roof_master_macro.csv`
   - The Python engine checks multiple locations automatically

2. **Adding New Line Items:**
   - Simply add rows to the CSV file
   - No code changes needed
   - Upload via UI or replace file directly

3. **Modifying Replacement Rules:**
   - Edit `apply_logic()` method in `roof_adjustment_engine.py`
   - Add new patterns to `replacement_rules` list
   - Format: `([carrier_patterns], roof_master_description)`

4. **API Endpoint:**
   - POST `/api/upload-roof-master`
   - Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
   - Field name: `file`
   - Returns JSON with success status and item count
