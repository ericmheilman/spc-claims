# 💬 User Prompt Workflow - Modal Implementation

## What Changed
Instead of displaying results inline on the page, the User Prompt Workflow now uses an **interactive modal popup** that guides users through prompts one at a time.

## Modal Features

### 🎯 Step-by-Step Navigation
- **One prompt at a time** - Clean, focused interface
- **Progress indicator** - Shows current question number and visual dots
- **Previous/Next buttons** - Easy navigation between prompts
- **Finish button** - Appears on the last prompt

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **Overlay backdrop** - Dark semi-transparent background
- **Centered modal** - Maximum 2xl width, 90vh height
- **Green theme** - Consistent with the workflow branding
- **Progress dots** - Green for completed, current highlighted, gray for upcoming
- **Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes

### 🔄 User Experience Flow
1. Click "💬 User Prompt Workflow" button
2. Modal pops up with first prompt
3. User reads prompt and makes selection
4. Click "Next →" to proceed to next prompt
5. Click "← Previous" to go back if needed
6. Click "Finish" on last prompt to close modal
7. Click "✕ Close" anytime to exit

### 📋 Prompt Display
Each prompt shows:
- **Title** with icon (⚠️ for warnings, 💡 for recommendations)

- **Items list** (for required items)
- **Options** (for selections)
- **Custom fields** (for user input)

### 🎛️ Navigation Controls
- **← Previous** - Disabled on first prompt

- **Finish** - Only on last prompt, closes modal
